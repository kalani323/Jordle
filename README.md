## Jordle (JavaFx Wordle)
Modeled after the New York Time's Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
 - Wordle is a game where you have six chances to guess a random secret five-letter word. 
 - Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are or aren't in the word. 
 - The aim is to figure out the secret word with the fewest guesses.
I was able to create a JavaFx GUI program that does the same thing along with buttons that allow for restart and instructions on how to play
